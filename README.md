# FedSiam: Towards Adaptive Federated Semi-Supervised Learning

A PyTorch implementation for the paper  **FedSiam: Towards Adaptive Federated Semi-Supervised Learning**

We provides the code for 5 baselines and 3 proposed FedSemi frameworks, two scenarios, six data distribution settings, and three datasets.

If you want to do experiments on labels-at-client or labels-at-server scenario. please choose the datafolder. There will provide detailed readme document for each setting!

Thanks!
